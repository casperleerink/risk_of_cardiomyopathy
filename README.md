# Cardiomyopathy risk calculator in childhood cancer survivors
This calculator estimates the probability of a left ventricular ejection fraction <40% within 10 years from a surveillance echocardiogram obtained at >5 years after cancer diagnosis in adult (>18 years) survivors of chilhood cancer treated with anthracyclines and/or chest-directed radiotherapy. The development and validation of the prediction model is described here: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaccao.2020.11.013.
