# Cardiomyopathy risk calculator in childhood cancer survivors
 <p>This calculator can be used in childhood cancer survivors to estimate the probability of left ventricular dysfunction 
                with ejection fraction <40% (LVD40) within 10 years from a surveillance echocardiogram obtained at >5 years after cancer diagnosis.   
                The outcome LVD40 was defined as a left ventricular ejection fraction <40% during follow-up, 
                the treshold for pharmacological heart failure treatment initiation in asymptomatic patients according to 
                the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and the American Heart Association (AHA) heart failure guidelines.
                The risk calculator was developed and validated for adult survivors of childhood cancer (18 years or older), >5 years after cancer diagnosis, treated with anthracyclines and/or chest-directed radiotherapy
                without heart failure and with a left ventricular ejection fraction >40% at time of the risk assessment.
                The prediction model development and validation is described in the publication from Leerink et al. JACC CardioOncology 2021 (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaccao.2020.11.013).
